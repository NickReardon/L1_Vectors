  This program will generate 15 random 3 digit numbers and 
  store them in a vector. Then it will:
    - Sort the numbers
    - Reverse the digits in each number
        - Store the reversed numbers in a new vector
	- Find the some of the 3 digits of each numbers
        - Store the sums in a new vector
    - Print all 3 vectors

      Notes: 
        - Numbers less than 100, will display with
          leading zeroes (eg. 009, rather than just 9)
        - Sums will be displayed associated with the 
          original number
